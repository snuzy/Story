"Joseph?", Ben nodded.
"Where do you live sir?", asked the officer as Ben approached the homicide scene. "And have you notice any strangers or strange occurances in the area, recently?"

"I live across from the pond", Ben stated.
"Where exactly, sir. I need your address."
"Look, I'm an officer too. Here's my badge." Ben shuffles through a batch of cards from his pocket.

The officer examines it and with squinted eyes, "I see a badge but I'll ask again. Where exactly do you live, Joseph, Benjamin or is it Sarge Edgar James?"

Ben looked defeated. There were no residential houses in the direction he'd implied. So, he made a run for it.
